    <h1>Pierce the Veil</h1>
    <p>Pierce the Veil is an American rock band formed in San Diego, California, in 2006.
    It was founded by brothers Vic and  Mike Fuentes after the disbanding of Before Today, 
    which formed out of the San Diego punk scene. Jaime Preciado and Tony Perry joined the group in 2007, 
    on bass and lead guitar respectively. <br> <br>
    
    Pierce the veil is another band I've been listening to for a long time now, their songs mean a lot to me,
    they're the reason why I got to meet my amazing partner, and I can't thank them enough for that. I've scene
    them 4 times now, they're good but their setlists suck, also they're all weirdos but we're not going to get into that.
