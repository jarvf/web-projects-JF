    <h1>Korn</h1>
    <p>Korn is an American nu metal band from Bakersfield, California, originally formed in 1993 by James "Munky" Shaffer,
    Reginald "Fieldy" Arvizu and David Silveria, who were members of the band L.A.P.D. <br><br>

    Another nu-metal classic, Korn is one of the bands that got me into rock/metal music. I've seen them twice now, once at rockville
    and recently here at metlife stadium co-headling with System of a Down. I absolutely love them. Also, if you ever see me in public,
    I'm usually rocking a pair of Korn sneakers.
