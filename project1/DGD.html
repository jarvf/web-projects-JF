    <h1>Dance Gavin Dance</h1>
    <p> Dance Gavin Dance is an American rock band from Sacramento, California, formed in 2005. 
    It consists of lead guitarist Will Swan, drummer Matthew Mingus, harsh vocalist Jon Mess, and  
    lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Andrew Wells. <br> <br>

    Dance Gavin Dance is a new addition to the list of bands I listen to (3 years), but theyv'e quickly
    become a staple in my music library. I've seen them live 5 times now, the first time being back in 2018,
    I had no idea who they were, but they were headlining (Went for the openers), I thought they were overhyped
    but I was wrong.
