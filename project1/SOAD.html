    <h1>Sytem of a Down</h1>
    <p>
        System of a Down (often abbreviated as SOAD or simply System) is an Armenian-American rock band formed in
        Glendale, California, in 1994. The band consists of vocalist Serj Tankian, guitarist and vocalist Daron
        Malakian, bassist Shavo Odadjian, and drummer John Dolmayan. They are known for their unique sound that blends
        elements of metal, punk, and traditional Armenian music, as well as their politically charged lyrics addressing
        issues such as war. (Copilot wrote this lol) <br><br>

        System of a Down is a band that means a lot to me, my best friend introduced me to them, and I never looked back.
        I've had the opportunity to see them live twice now, and both times were incredible experiences that I will never forget.
