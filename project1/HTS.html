    <h1>Hail the Sun</h1>
    <p> Hail the Sun is an American post-hardcore band from Chico, California. Formed in 2009,
    the band currently consists of  lead vocalist and drummer Donovan Melero, guitarist Shane Gann, guitarist Aric Garcia,
    bass guitarist John Stirrat, and touring and studio drummer Allen Casillas. <br> <br>

    Hail the Sun is a band I've been listening to for almost 10 years now, they are the first band I've ever seen live,
    back in 2018, opening for Dance Gavin Dance actually. They're also the band I've seen the most, with almost 10 shows now.
    They're such a unique and humble band, and I can't recommend them enough. Also the vocalist also plays drum at the same time, dude's a beast.
